# aimonopoly

This is an experiment. 
I started with Google Gemini and asked it to build a Monopoly game and went from there. 
The conceit was to pretend to be a Systems Analyst, but instead of telling
a team of software developers what I needed, I would be telling Gemini.
I tried not to look too much at the code it generated, and when I noticed a bug
in an update, I would reproduce the symptoms and tell Gemini the symptoms I 
saw, rather than, "You misspelled a variable on line 1043."
