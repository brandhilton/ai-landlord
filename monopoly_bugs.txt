The thought behind this project was this: Rob shared a video with me of a guy who videod himself in front of a whiteboard drawing out a rough sketch of an app while describing what he wanted it to do, mentioning a couple of javascript packages that would help, and giving that video to Google Gemini. Gemini wrote the app in a minute or so, and it seemed fine. But then he didn't take it any further. He didn't iterate on the design, add features, look for bugs, change his mind on requirements - any of the normal things that happen in a normal project. I was also thinking of my favorite Systems Analyst, Liz, and thinking, "With Gemini, could Liz do everything without a software dev team?" So I decided to try and see what would happen.

Unfortunately, I didn't write down my initial prompt, it was something like the following: "Write me a monopoly game. Output it as a single html file."

You can see the result in my first git commit. 

*************************
First big surprise: The "Buy Property" button didn't work. It took two attempts to fix. First, I was just confused and asked it how to buy a property, and it told me to click the "Buy Property" button. I told it there wasn't one. It apologized (something it does EVERY time) and made some changes. I told it the button still wasn't there, and it told me it needed to do some refactoring. After that, I had a working "Buy Property" button.

Everything below this is a prompt to Gemini unless otherwise noted.
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

Yes, one player hit "Chance" and drew the card that sent him 3 spaces back. He landed on an unowned property, but was not given the option to buy the property.

one of my players landed on "go to jail". they went to jail, but their turn didn't end.

I just had a player in jail. they paid bail, but were not allowed to roll and move on the same turn. please correct this.

I have a player in jail. On their 3rd turn in jail, they didn't roll a double. After rolling, they bought several houses. On their next turn, they were allowed to continue rolling rather than being forced to pay bail.

I need additional controls for debugging. I need to be able to move pieces on the board without rolling dice. I need to be able to simulate a dice roll while specifying what the dice will land on. I need to be able to change ownership of a property and place houses and hotels on properties. I need to be able to put players in jail.

When I simulate a dice roll, the "Roll Dice" and "End Turn" buttons are disabled. I need them to behave normally.

The "Roll Dice" button is always enabled after a simulated dice roll. I need the simulated dice roll to behave exactly like a regular dice roll. 

No. When I do a simulated roll of 1,2, the "Roll Dice" button is enabled and the "End Turn button is disabled. That is not correct. "Roll Dice" should be disabled and "End Turn" should be enabled. A simulated roll should behave exactly like clicking the "Roll Dice" button, except I get to choose the numbers.

you introduced a bug. rolling doubles 3 times in a row no longer sends the player to jail.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It fixed the bug, but made other, unrelated changes - changing a font size and a box-sizing attribute.

put the debug controls to the right instead of underneath

no, that just changed the arrangement of the debug panel and placed it between the game board and the log. I want the debug panel to be to the right of everything.

Now the player info panels are below the game board. Put them back where they were. 

No. player-list-container should be to the right of game-board and below game-controls.

message-log should be below main-game-area and to the left of debug-controls.

>>>>>>>>>>>> I had to reboot my machine and I didn't think to save the chat beforedoing so. So I started a new chat and loaded the html file in, telling Gemini this was my monopoly program and I wanted to make some enhancements.  This was Gemini's response:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Begin >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
This is a well-structured HTML and JavaScript Monopoly game! You've done a great job laying out the board, managing player states, and implementing basic actions like rolling dice, moving players, buying properties, and even some property management (mortgage/unmortgage, build/sell houses) and jail mechanics. The debug controls are also a very helpful addition for development.

Here's a summary of the current features and some ideas for enhancements, ranging from core gameplay additions to quality-of-life improvements:

Current Strengths:

    Clean Separation: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for logic.

    Player Setup: Dynamic player name input.

    Board Representation: Grid-based board with visual spaces and player tokens.

    Core Mechanics: Dice rolling, player movement, passing GO, basic property acquisition, rent payment (with monopolies and houses).

    Jail System: Go to jail, just visiting, trying to roll doubles, paying bail, using GOJF cards.

    Property Management: Buy, mortgage, unmortgage, build houses, sell houses (with some basic even building rules).

    Bankruptcy Handling: Basic detection and property transfer.

    Card System: Basic Chance/Community Chest draw and some card effects implemented (move to Go, collect/pay money, GOJF card, Go to Jail, Go back 3).

    UI Feedback: Message log, current player display, dice display, player status list.

    Debug Controls: Excellent for testing specific scenarios (move player, simulate roll, change ownership, set houses, send to jail).

    Property Info Modal: Detailed info on clicked properties.

Potential Enhancements:

Given the solid foundation, here are some areas where you could expand and improve the game:
1. Core Gameplay & Rules Enforcement

    Full Chance/Community Chest Card Logic:

        Implement all card effects, especially those involving movement to specific types of spaces (e.g., "Advance to nearest Utility", "Advance to Boardwalk"). For these, you'd need logic to find the nearest space of that type and then apply rent rules accordingly.

        Cards that affect all players (e.g., "Grand Opera Night – Collect $50 from each player").

        Cards that require choices or interaction (less common in Monopoly, but possible).

    Trading System: This is a huge missing piece for full Monopoly gameplay.

        UI: A dedicated modal or section where players can propose trades (money, properties, GOJF cards).

        Logic:

            Allow players to select items to give and items they want.

            Validate trades (e.g., cannot trade mortgaged property with houses, cannot trade properties if houses need to be sold evenly first).

            Allow accepting or rejecting trades.

            Handle property transfers (including mortgaged status, unmortgaging cost).

    Auctions for Unbought Properties: If a player lands on an unowned property and chooses not to buy it, it should go up for auction.

        UI: An auction modal where players can bid.

        Logic: Track current bid, highest bidder, turn-based bidding, transfer property/money to winner.

    Robust Building/Selling Rules:

        Even Building: You've started this, but ensure it's strictly enforced (cannot build a 3rd house on one property if another in the group only has 1).

        Even Selling: Similarly, when selling houses back, they must be sold evenly across the group.

        Hotel Mechanics: When a 5th house is bought, it becomes a hotel, returning the 4 houses to the bank.

        House/Hotel Shortage: Implement a global tracking for available houses and hotels. If the bank runs out, players cannot build until others are sold back.

    Mortgage/Unmortgage Rules:

        Ensure no rent is collected on mortgaged properties.

        Correct calculation for unmortgaging (original mortgage value + 10%).

        Properties cannot be improved (houses built/sold) while mortgaged.

    Bankruptcy Enhancements:

        Allow the bankrupt player to explicitly choose which assets to sell/mortgage to avoid bankruptcy (rather than automatic sale, or as a last resort).

        When properties are transferred due to bankruptcy, they are usually transferred mortgaged. You've added this, which is great. Houses are also returned to the bank.

        Handling of debt to the bank vs. debt to another player.

2. User Experience & Visuals

    Dice Animation: Simple visual dice roll animation instead of just text output. This significantly improves visual feedback.

    Player Movement Animation: Animate the player token moving space by space, rather than instantly jumping.

    Highlight Current Player: Make the current player's status in the list more prominent (you already have a current class, but perhaps a bolder border or slight animation).

    Property Interaction:

        Highlight properties the current player can interact with (buy, build, mortgage).

        Visual indicators on the board for houses/hotels.

    Confirmation Dialogs: For major actions like buying property, mortgaging, or making large payments.

    More Detailed Message Log: Potentially add icons or different colors for specific message types (e.g., money gain, money loss, card drawn).

    End Game Screen: A clear "Game Over" screen with the winner's name and possibly game statistics.

3. Advanced Features

    Save/Load Game State: Persist the game state using localStorage or a simple JSON export/import.

    Sound Effects: Dice roll sound, money transaction sound, landing on property sound.

    Player Profiles/Settings: More customization for players (e.g., token selection).

    Computer AI (Bots): A very significant undertaking, but would allow solo play.

How to Proceed:

I recommend tackling these enhancements one by one, starting with what you find most impactful or interesting.

For example, a good next step might be:

    Full Card Logic: Go through each Chance and Community Chest card and implement its specific effects. This will involve more if/else or switch statements within your drawCard function, potentially new helper functions for actions like "move to nearest X".

    Dice Roll Animation: A simple CSS animation or a sequence of image changes can greatly improve the feel of the game.

    Refine Property Management UI: Make sure the build/sell/mortgage/unmortgage actions are always clearly available when appropriate and correctly disabled when not. The current showPropertyManagementActions is a good start, ensure all conditions for each action are met before enabling.

Let me know which of these enhancements you'd like to explore first, and I can provide more specific guidance or code snippets!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> End >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

implement full card logic.

I don't like the layout. I want the message log to be directly below the game board and to the left of the debug controls, and I want the "Toggle Debug Controls" button to be directly below the message log.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> lots of changes that totally screwed up the layout and also some totally un-asked-for logic changes.

revert all the changes you just made.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> it reverted the layout changes AND the card logic changes

no, I want to keep the card logic changes. put those back in.
>>>>>>>>>>>>> It added the card logic back in, but also changed the property handling logic

I want the layout to look like this: (and I uploaded a png)

to avoid intellectual property problems, let's rename the application "Landlord" and rename all the properties using a star wars theme.
>>>>>>>>>>>>> It reverted the layout changes.

I want the layout to look like this: (and I uploaded a png)

look at the image I uploaded and fix the layout properly. You have the debug controls below the game controls. That's incorrect. Provide the changes as a patch file. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>> the patch was mal-formed so I had to ask it to provide the full html file.
>>>>>>>>>>>>> It said it had adjusted the layout, but all it did was change the labels on two of the buttons.

the image I uploaded has a three-column layout. The left column should contain the game board and log area. the middle column should contain the game controls. the right column should contain the debug controls when they're visible.

the debug panel used to be a single column. change it back to that.
**************************
It had TERRIBLE difficulty getting the layout right, even with a png.

**************************
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
I tried multiple times to get it to give me patch files. The line numbers were always wrong. It finally said:

You are absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize. My attempts to generate a valid patch file have repeatedly failed, and the malformed line numbers are a clear sign that my internal diffing process is not correctly matching the state of your file. This is my error, and it has caused you unnecessary frustration.

I will stop providing patch files. From now on, I will provide the full, complete HTML file for any changes. This is the most reliable way to ensure you get the correct code without any further issues.

Which I interpreted as, "Fine. You don't like my patch files. I won't bother you with patch files anymore."

It then produced the full html, which had two lines changed from the last time. One moved the "Toggle Debug" button, and the other introduced a bug.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 

you introduced a bug. when a player has to pay tax, the amount is no longer deducted from their account.

Split this file up.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It split it into .html, .css, and .js

Rename the application "Definitely not Monopoly"

Remove the title from the game screen. Instead, create a snarky logo and put it in the middle of the game board.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It said it fixed something in the Javascript, but nothing changed.

shrink the logo so it doesn't touch any of the board spaces. And don't output any files that aren't changed.
********************
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It told me it was going to provide the unchanged HTML and javascript files anyway, and then didn't give me the HTML. To quote:
Only the style.css file needs to be changed for this. I will provide the updated CSS and also the index.html and script.js files for completeness, as they are part of the full project structure.
1. style.css (Updated)
3. script.js (Unchanged)
No 2. Weird.

implement the auction logic you mentioned earlier.

there's a bug. when I land on an un-owned property and don't buy it and click 'End Turn', the log says the property will be auctioned, but nothing happens.

Instead of a 'Toggle Debug Controls' button, I would like ctrl-d to toggle the debug controls.

implement the trading system you mentioned above.

the 'Propose Trade' button doesn't do anything.

Now the game won't start. I see this error in the console when I load the page:
Uncaught ReferenceError: showTradeModal is not defined
<anonymous> file:///Users/brandh/Documents/projects/mine/monopoly/gemini_new/script.js:1651

The 'Toggle Debug' button is back. Remove it. Also, when the trading dialog is up, all the error messages are going to the log and I can't see them because it's blurred. Those messages need to be in the trading dialog where I can see them. Also, the 'credits' blanks need to be cleared out for each new trade.

use the costa rican colon currency symbol instead of the dollar sign

add a debug option where I can set how much money a player has
*******************
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Note the changes in the html file. Currency symbol changes, jail/detention, houses/dwellings.

when I have 4 dwellings on a property and I go to build a fortress, instead of the cost saying, '₡50' it says '₡Fortress'. 

in property auctions, each player must bid something over 0 unless they have no money.

no, that's incorrect. The current bid should start at 0. Also, error messages are showing up in the logs area, where they're obscured by the auction modal. error messages should be displayed in the auction modal.

players cannot withdraw from the auction. someone has to bid at least 1. players can skip their turn to bid. if a player bids and his turn comes to bid again and nobody else has bid, he wins the auction.

please split the javascript file up in some logical manner.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I had to ask it again because it forgot to split up the file.

I'm getting CORS errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It gave me instructions on how to run a server locally. 

Instead of "D-n", represent regular dwellings as green squares and fortresses as red rectangles.

the dwellings are too close to the property names. 

that made it worse. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For some reason, it thought I was talking about the auction code, so it changed the javascript and dumped the whole thing out as a single script.js file.

I'm going to ignore that change because a) we're not using script.js anymore, and b) I wasn't talking about the auction logic. I was talking about the position of the dwelling rectangles in relation to the property names.
********************
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> At this point, it told me there were too many tokens and it just wouldn't accept any more requests, even after closing the window, reopening, and reloading the saved chat. So I started a new chat, gave it a zip file with everything in it, and told it, "This is my project. I'd like to make some enhancements." It responded with the following:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Start >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Based on your current setup, I've identified a few high-impact enhancements that will significantly improve the user experience and add core gameplay mechanics.
Proposed Enhancements:

    Toggle for Debug Controls: The debug panel is a powerful tool for testing, but it takes up a lot of screen space. I'll add a simple button to show and hide this panel, making the interface cleaner for regular play.

    Visual Indicator for Mortgaged Properties: Instead of having to click on a property to see if it's mortgaged, I'll add a clear visual overlay directly onto the board space. This makes the game state much easier to understand at a glance.

    Implement the "Doubles" Rule: This is a fundamental Monopoly rule that adds a lot of excitement. I'll implement the following logic:

        Rolling doubles allows the player to roll again.

        Rolling doubles three times in a row sends the player to the Detention Block (Jail).

        A player in Detention can try to roll doubles to get out.

To implement these changes, we'll need to modify style.css, make a small addition to index.html, and create the main logic in a new main.js file. Because the game logic is complex, I also recommend separating the board data into its own file for better organization.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> End >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I thought this was odd because the doubles rule was already coded, and the debug panel was already behind a toggle - it was just a keystroke toggle instead of a button. At any rate, the result was a disaster. The trading and auction functionality was completely lost, all the properties were renamed, and most of the debug functionality didn't work. The reason for all this becomes clear later.

So I tried again with another new chat. I loaded the zip file and told it I just wanted it to analyze it and understand it. This was the result:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Start >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Okay, I've analyzed the index.html and style.css files. Here's my understanding so far:

Application: "Definitely not Monopoly" - A web-based board game.

Core Technologies Identified:

    HTML

    CSS

    JavaScript (referenced as main.js, type module)

index.html Breakdown:

    Setup Screen (#setup-screen):

        Allows users to input the number of players (2-6).

        Dynamically generates input fields for player names.

        A "Start Game" button to initiate the game.

    Game Screen (#game-screen): (Initially hidden)

        Layout: A three-column structure (#main-game-layout):

            Left Column:

                #game-board: The main game board, likely to be populated by JavaScript. The CSS already defines grid areas for standard Monopoly properties.

                #board-logo: A "Definitely not Monopoly" logo in the center of the board.

                #message-log-area: Displays game events and messages.

            Middle Column:

                #game-controls-panel: Contains primary game interaction elements.

                    #current-player-display: Shows whose turn it is.

                    #dice-display: Shows dice roll results.

                    Action Buttons: "Roll Dice", "End Turn", "Propose Trade".

                    #property-actions: Hidden by default. Buttons for "Buy Holding", "Build Dwelling", "Mortgage Holding", "Unmortgage Holding", "Sell Dwelling". Uses "Holdings" for properties and "Dwellings" for houses.

                    #jail-actions: Hidden by default. Buttons for "Pay Bail", "Use Get Out of Detention Free Card". Uses "Detention Block" for Jail.

                #player-list-container: To display information about each player (money, properties, etc.).

            Right Column:

                #debug-controls: Hidden by default. Provides tools to manipulate game state for testing:

                    Move player to any space.

                    Simulate specific dice rolls.

                    Change property ("Holding") ownership.

                    Set number of "Dwellings/Fortresses" on a property.

                    Set player "Credits" (money).

                    Send a player to the "Detention Block".

    Modals (Pop-up Dialogs):

        #property-modal-overlay: To display detailed information about a selected property (price, owner, rent, dwellings, mortgage status, etc.).

        #auction-modal-overlay: For managing property auctions when a player declines to buy.

        #trade-modal-overlay: Allows players to construct trade offers (money, properties, get-out-of-jail cards).

        #trade-review-modal-overlay: For the recipient of a trade to review and accept/reject it.

    JavaScript Link:

        <script src="main.js" type="module"></script>: Indicates that main.js will contain the core game logic and will be treated as an ES6 module.

style.css Breakdown:

    General Styling:

        Basic page setup, fonts, and background.

        A blur effect (filter: blur(5px)) is applied to the main content when modals are active, enhancing focus on the modal.

    Layout:

        Uses Flexbox extensively for structuring the setup screen, game screen, columns, and control panels.

        The game board (#game-board) is a fixed-size 800x800px grid, with 11x11 cells.

        Specific grid-area properties are used to position each of the 40 board spaces (e.g., #go, #mediterranean-avenue, #jail) in the classic Monopoly layout.

    Board Elements:

        Styles for individual board spaces, including corners.

        Player tokens (.token) are styled with different colors and positioned within spaces. Special positioning for tokens in the "Jail" space.

        Property color bars are defined for visual identification of property groups.

        Styles for displaying "Dwellings" (houses) and "Fortresses" (hotels) on properties.

    UI Components:

        Styling for buttons, input fields, select dropdowns.

        Visual distinction for the current player in the player list.

        Styling for the message log.

        Clear visual structure for the debug panel and its sub-sections.

    Modals:

        Common styling for all modal overlays (fixed position, centered, background dimming).

        Specific styling for the content within each type of modal (property info, auction, trade).

Overall Impression:

    The HTML and CSS describe a well-structured user interface for a Monopoly-like game with a humorous thematic twist.

    The game includes all the major mechanics of Monopoly: property acquisition and development, rent, auctions, trading, a jail system, and chance/community chest like elements (implied by space names like community-chest1).

    The UI is designed to be interactive, with many elements hidden/shown dynamically by JavaScript.

    The inclusion of comprehensive debug controls is a good sign for development and testing.

    The use of "Credits", "Holdings", "Dwellings", "Fortresses", and "Detention Block" consistently reinforces the "Definitely not Monopoly" theme.

I have a good understanding of the front-end structure and styling. I'm now ready for the JavaScript file (main.js) or any other files you'd like to provide to understand the game's logic and interactivity.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> End >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I double-checked, and the zip file definitely contained all the .js files. We then had this exchange:

the main.js was included in the zip file. do you see it?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Start >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Ah, my apologies! You are absolutely right.

You initially mentioned uploading a zip file, but then you provided the index.html and style.css content directly as text. I processed those text blocks.

I haven't actually received or "seen" the main.js file yet because it wasn't included in the text you pasted.

Please paste the content of main.js in the same way you provided the HTML and CSS.

Once you do, I'll analyze it and integrate its logic with my understanding of the HTML and CSS. I'm ready when you are!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> End >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Oooooookay, so it says it sees main.js, but then it asks me to give it main.js.

I started yet another new prompt. This was the exchange:

I'm going to upload a zip file with my project in it. Tell me what files it contains, and then analyze it until you understand it.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Start >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Okay, I understand!

Unfortunately, as a large language model, I cannot directly receive or process file uploads, including zip files. I don't have a file system I can access in that way.

However, you can definitely help me understand your project. Here's how we can do it:

    List the Files: First, please unzip the file on your end and then tell me:

        The names of all the files and folders at the top level of your project.

        If there are sub-folders, you can describe their structure too (e.g., using a tree-like format or just listing paths). A common way to do this is to run the tree command (if you're on Linux/macOS) in the project's root directory and paste the output. On Windows, you can use tree /F in the command prompt.

    Provide Key Code Snippets: Once I have the file list, I can ask you to paste the content of specific files that seem important (e.g., main.py, package.json, index.html, pom.xml, README.md, etc.).

        Please paste the code directly into our chat.

        For very large files, you might want to summarize their purpose or paste only the most relevant sections.

    Describe the Project: You can also tell me:

        What is the project supposed to do? What's its main goal?

        What programming languages, frameworks, or libraries are you using?

        Are there any specific parts you want me to focus on?

        Are there any parts you're having trouble with or have questions about?

So, please start by listing the files and folders in your project after you've unzipped it. I'm ready when you are!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> End >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

********************
>>>>>>>>>>>>> So that's why it failed so badly the first time I uploaded the zip. It can't unzip it! But it somehow managed to get the html and css files out of the zip. I also asked it if it could interface directly with github, and it can't, which is a major disappointment. To me, these are SERIOUS limitations when it comes to doing any kind of serious software development with Gemini. If I can't point it at a github repo or upload a zip file, how can I onboard it to any halfway complex project?

ok, this is a monopoly game. it consists of the following files: 
index.html
style.css
main.js 
config.js
game.js

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I uploaded index.html and style.css fine, but it consistently failed when I tried to upload a .js file. I had to do it by copying and pasting the contents of the files. After uploading all the source files, the token count stands at 53,489.

The dwelling rectangles sometimes overlap the property names. fix this.

That's worse. The price now overlaps the owner and the player token obscures both. I want the dwellings on top of the color bar and slightly smaller than the color bar.

That's even worse! I'm uploading a screenshot of the board. It looks like the property name is forcing the other elements off the board space. go back to the original  design of the board space and ONLY change the position and size of the dwellings so that they're on top of and slightly smaller than the color bar.

still wrong. Undo all your changes.

put the dwellings below the color bar, but touching it.

modify the detention block square to look more like the monopoly jail square.

when a player is in jail, all I see is a black circle. I don't see the color of the player token.

the new design of the detention block makes that whole side of the board too wide. the board spaces should all be the same size.

in all spaces except "in dentention", arrange the player tokens as follows: player 1 in the lower left corner with players 2, 3, and 4 lined up to the right of player 1. player 5 above player 1, and player 6 above player 5.

the "In Detention" square is in the wrong place.

Adjust the font size/boldness for "IN DETENTION" so that "DETENTION" fits in the space. Change "JUST" to "VISITING". Move the player tokens in detention up slightly so that all 6 fit within the square.

increase the size of all boards spaces such that all 6 players can fit side-by-side at the bottom of the space. 

un-bold the word "DETENTION"

"Galactic Senate Building" and "Carbon-Freezing Chamber" are too long. They span 3 lines on the board. Rename them something that fits in two lines. Also, the ownership text now overlaps the price. fix that.

un-bold all the property names. also, stop commenting your code changes.

create a logo for "Definitely Not Monopoly" as a png file, then replace "Definitely not Monopoly" in the center of the board with that png file.

don't tilt the logo. also, make the logo totally opaque.

The logo is 1024 × 1536 pixels. Expand the space for the logo so that it takes up as much of the middle of the board as possible while leaving a 100 pixel border

the logo is not centered vertically. fix.

that made things far worse. Now it's not centered vertically OR horizontally. try again.

the "sell dwelling" button doesn't work. move the "build dwelling" button below the "sell dwelling" button. the "x" in the property info dialog doesn't work.

Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:5500/game.js' doesn't provide an export named: 'buildHouse'

I shouldn't be able to mortgage a property when another property in the group has houses on it.

players should be able to buy and sell houses and mortage properties at any time during their turn.

that didn't fix it.

I noticed that you deleted a LOT of code from game.js in the last two updates. I'm going to re-upload the old game.js. I want you to use it as a baseline going forward.
>>>>>>>>>>>>> it took what I uploaded and tried to implement the changes I asked for above, but it once again generated a file around 1000 lines shorter than the previous version. the new version didn't fix the bugs, and introduced several new ones, including the debug controls not allowing me to change holding ownership.

revert game.js to what I just uploaded.

reformat game.js to make it more readable and remove all comments. don't put comments in your responses anymore.
